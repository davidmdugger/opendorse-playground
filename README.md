Hi, opendorse team!

I created this repository just for you. It's a clone of the backend of my other repo called Denver Developer Depot. Essentially, I've removed the authentication from the backend API, and I deleted the frontend and wrote a small tutorial app.

I will add more to the project throughout the week.
